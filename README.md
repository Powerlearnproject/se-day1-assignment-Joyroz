Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A branch of computer science used for developing, maintaining and testing software.
Importances;
Efficiency - optimize developer workflow with quality standards.
Data security - implement authentication and encription to safeguard users' stored information.
Flexibility - ensures the system's performance is not affected by increased load.
Reliability - ensures that the required processes are executed


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Identifying purpose of the software and the scope
Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification
Design - involves building the appropriae framework
Coding/Development - involves converting software design into tangible code
Testing - examining the software for glitches and bugs


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential software development approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Appropriatesess;
Best for projects with well defined requirements and little expected change.
Banking systems - since changes must be minimum
Construction software - there is strict compliance with regulations

Agile methodology - An incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration and continuous improvement.
Appropriateness;
Best for projects that require frequent user feedback.
Game development - need for frequent testing and feedback
Evolving business applications - eg, CRM and ERP, that update based on user needs

   
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - writing code to build software applications
Quality assurance engineer - testign the quality of software by identifyin bugs and ensuring it meets requiremnets
Project Manager - defining project goals, timelines and resource requirements


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software applications that provide comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
Examples; Visual studio, VS code
Importance;
Enhances the quality of code
Increases productivity

VCSs are systems that record changes to a file over time to recall specific versions later.
Examples; Git, GitHub
Importance;
Change tracking
Backup and recovery
   
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing project requirements cause delays
Deadlines and time constaints may compromise quality
Inneffective communication and collaboration -
Security challenges
Testing and quality assurance
Strategies;
Application of Agile methodologies
Effective time management and realistic time estimates
Use of clear communication channels and collaborative tools
Ensure regular securoty audits
Ensure thorough testing


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - tests individual units of code. It Catches bugs early in development
Intergration testing - Tests how different software components interact with each other when combined. It ensures the system functions smoothly as a whole
System testing - Tests the complete software system against functional and non functional requirements. Ensures the system meets overall project objectives and user needs
Acceptance testing - Final stage of testing where the software is evaluated to ensure it meets user requirements. Ensures the software is usable and provides the final check to know of any issues before it is released
  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Understanding how to effectively communicate with AI systems to solve real world problems.
It gives developers more control over users interaction with the AI
Helps the AI to refine the output and present it in the required format

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Make the page detailed"
Improved; "Add detailed technical specifications such as dimensions and material composition."
